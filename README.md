## Technical details:

This was a rather tricky extension to get working in sessions served from MyBinder.org/Binder. Solution based mainly on [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39169844/8508004) and [here](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyter-extension/blob/1fecbd818ef84980ec1043e4b57edebf7053d1f9/postBuild).
